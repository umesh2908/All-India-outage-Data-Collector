# All-India-outage-Data-Collector 
This repository contains a Python script that allows you to download outage reports from Indian Regional Load Dispatch Centers (RLDCs) and store them in a single folder on your local system. The script automates the process of fetching outage reports from multiple RLDCs, making it convenient for data analysis and other purposes.
